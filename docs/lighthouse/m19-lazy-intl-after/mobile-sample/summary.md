# M19 mobile diagnostic sample - not certification

Scope: selected pages only. Full milestone certification remains open.
Runs per page: 1. Performance and timing use medians; accessibility and best practices use the lowest observed score. Origin storage and HTTP cache are cold for each trace.

Transport: HTTP/2 over TLS with an ephemeral key pinned only in the audit browser. Normal hosted TLS and deployment performance remain separate release evidence.
